            <p>
            Our names are Felix Xie and Larris Xie and we are brothers who decided to start ReturnBin in 2021. 
We are both students currently studying at the same school and have interests in web development,
competitive programming, and technology. ReturnBin is our first project (first time trying web dev/using html and css) and it will certainly 
not be the last.

        In a year, the average person loses about 1.24 items worth nearly $100, which totals to billions of dollars gone collectively. 
However, the loss of the items go beyond the price; some people waste more than 2.5 days annually trying to find or 
retrieve their items and many items have irreplaceable sentimental value to their owners. Additionally, less than half of 
the recovered items are even claimed! <br> <br> That's why we created <b>ReturnBin</b>, allowing people around the world to reunite with their lost items.
